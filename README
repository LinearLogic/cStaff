#<<---->> cStaff 1.6 <<---->>

Finally, all those confused players know who to ask for help!  Simply type /staff to see:
  - Names of online staff members (players with the 'cstaff.staff' permission node will show up in this list)
  - Names of online donors (players with the 'cstaff.donor' permission node will show up in this list
  - Online player count

Now with 6 different built-in color schemes to choose from! Check out the ColorScheme section in the config!

Compiled with CB 1.3.1 R2.0

Authors: LinearLogic and Developher

###Changelog (1.5.2 --> 1.6.1)
- Added Op handling to config.yml (by default, Ops show up as staff, but not donors)

- Compiled cStaff against CraftBukkit 1.3.1 R2.0
###Changelog (1.4.1 --> 1.5.1)
